# Tierlist-Website

-The link for the static [website](https://KidusLegesse.github.io/TierList). The site is hosted by github pages thus it won't allow any api calls however the code shows how I implemented the movie search functionality. 

-**A website where users can search for movies (provided by an OMDB api) and rank those chosen movies in a tierlist. Implemented using HTML, CSS, and the React JavaScript framework.**
