🪴**Website description:** A website where users can search for movies/shows 🍿 and rank them in a tierlist.

👷‍♂️**How does it work?** There is a search bar where users can input the movies or shows they are looking for. When provided with search matches users can click on a movie/show to add its cover into a box where they can drag and drop it in a tier of their choice. Tiers can also be added and removed so if the user desires only 3 tiers or if they want 10 it is possible by clicking the add tier or remove tier buttons.

🧰🛠️**Libraries and Tools:** CSS, BootStrap, NodeJs, React, JavaScript, and OMDB API.

<h3>🌄Extra information:</h3>
After selecting a movie/show it is added to local storage so if users exit the page or refresh the selected movies/shows along with the most recent tierlist will remain.

<h3>Frontend User Interface:</h3>
