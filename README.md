# Tierlist-Website

The link for the [website](https://KidusLegesse.github.io/TierList). 

The site is hosted by github pages thus it won't allow any api calls that are not https and the OMDB api I am using is onyly http. However, the repository includes the code I implmented for the movie search functionality. 

**A website where users can search for movies (provided by an OMDB api) and rank those chosen movies in a tierlist. Implemented using HTML, CSS, and the React JavaScript framework.**
